# DreamWriter
Just a small program that should be run in Ubuntu (probably other distros work as well) running an X server.

It capture and nullifies ALL keystrokes. The only way to re-establish control of the keyboard is to press ESC 10 times in a row.

Pressing ENTER 5 times in a row will start the writing of a dream, and pressing ESC 5 times in a row will signal the end of a written dream. On end, it will be sent to be cleaned and corrected by Claude, and then posted as an entry on Notion.

Not very portable as it stands (assumes Claude and Notion), but please let me know if you find it interesting, and I can amend it to make it a little more portable. Or you can do it yourself!
